    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd nayas-twenty
    ```

2.  Install dependencies:

### Building for Production

To build the application for production:

```

This will create an optimized build in the `.next` folder.

## üöÄ Deployment to Vercel

Vercel is a great platform for deploying Next.js applications.

1.  **Sign up/Log in to Vercel**: Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com/) and create an account or log in.
2.  **Connect your Git Repository**:
    *   Click "Add New..." -> "Project".
    *   Import your Git repository (e.g., from GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).
3.  **Configure Project**:
    *   Vercel usually auto-detects Next.js projects. The default settings should work.
    *   **Framework Preset**: Should be "Next.js".
    *   **Build Command**: `npm run build` or `yarn build` (usually `next build`).
    *   **Output Directory**: `.next` (Vercel default for Next.js).
    *   **Install Command**: `npm install` or `yarn install`.
    *   You can add Environment Variables if needed (e.g., for API keys if you extend the app).
4.  **Deploy**: Click the "Deploy" button. Vercel will build and deploy your application.
5.  **Access Your Site**: Once deployed, Vercel will provide you with a URL to access your live application (e.g., `nayas-twenty-xxxx.vercel.app`). You can also set up a custom domain.

### Placeholder Assets

This project uses placeholder audio files in the `public/audio/` directory. For a complete experience, replace these files with actual audio content:

*   `public/audio/background_music.mp3`: Gentle background music.
*   `public/audio/page-turn.mp3`: Sound effect for page transitions.
*   `public/audio/confetti_sound.mp3`: Sound effect for confetti.
*   `public/audio/naya_message.mp3`: Personalized voice message for Page 5.
*   `public/audio/surprise_soundtrack.mp3`: Surprise audio for the Final Page.

Images are currently using `https://placehold.co`. Replace these with actual photos as desired, using the `next/image` component.

## üí° Future Enhancements (Optional)

*   **Full Swipeable Pages**: Integrate a library like SwiperJS (React version) or Framer Motion for more fluid, touch-based page transitions.
*   **Database Integration**: Use Firebase Firestore or a similar service to store user-uploaded content or dynamic messages (if the app were to be configurable by others).
*   **More Animations**: Add more SVG/CSS animations for doodles, floating hearts, etc.
*   **"Shake to Reveal"**: Implement motion API for mobile-specific interactions.
*   **Custom Audio Recorder**: Allow users to record a voice message directly in the app.
